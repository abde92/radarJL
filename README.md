## Simulation of an Altimeter RADAR System 
This project models and simulates an altimeter radar system using Julia. The simulation includes the generation of radar signals, processing of reflected signals, and computation of altitude. It aims to provide an educational tool and a foundation for further research in radar technology. Contributions and improvements are welcome to expand its capabilities and applications.
